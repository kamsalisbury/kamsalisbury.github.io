title: HyperV 2019 Azure Arc Playbook  
description: Connect HyperV 2019 to Azure Arc
---

There are many HyperV "Free" Server configuration guides on the Internet. None of them account for the latest, and probably last, enhancements to integrate and control the core operating system and hyper visor.

## Here is my HyperV Server 2019 playbook

1. After a normal install and reboot, rename the Administrator account. This security through obscurity change enables quickly identifying brute force attacks as the username has to be guessed before the password can be cracked.
```wmic UserAccount where Name="Administrator" call Rename Name="new-unique-name"```

2. Install [Windows Admin Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/windows-admin-center). This enables local network as well as [control of the Azure Arc HyperV 2019 Server through the Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/azure/manage-vm).

3. [OnBoard to Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/onboard-portal).

4. Add any additonal Azure Arc VM Extensions. For example, the [Azure Automation Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/extension-based-hybrid-runbook-worker-install?tabs=windows%2Ccli#code-try-23).

*Boom* HyperV 2019 Server is now Azure Connected and Controlled. Now Azure Update Center can push patch updates to it, etc.

###### Notes

1. HyperV Server 2019 was used for this topic. [HyperV Server Free is essentially a zombie product](https://www.altaro.com/hyper-v/end-of-hyper-v-server/).
