My markdown test page inspired by [Github Basic Formatting Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and [Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading

**This is bold text**

_This text is italicized_

~~This was strike through text~~

**This text is _extremely_ important**

***All this text is important***

<sub>This is a subscript text</sub>

<sup>This is a superscript text</sup>

Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote

Use `inline code` in sentences.

A code block:
```
ls -alh
df -h
cat /tmp/file.txt
```

More code blocks:
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```
