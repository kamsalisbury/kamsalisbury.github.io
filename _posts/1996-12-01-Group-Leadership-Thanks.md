Leadership Thanks - 305th Logistics Support Group

Received a leadership thank you letter from the Commander of the 305th Logistics Group to the
Commander of the 30th Logistics Support Squadron for my service in support of the Head Quarters Air
Mobility Command directed Computer Security Accredidation. I automated computer security scans of
all networked computers, producing tabulated results. I then used those results to remediate all vulnerability
scan findings as well as secure the network for future use. I also used those findings as well as provided
training materials to conduct computer security training.
