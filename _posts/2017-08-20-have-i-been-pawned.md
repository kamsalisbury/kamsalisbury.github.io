As of today, according to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com" target="_blank">https://haveibeenpwned.com</a>, 228 websites have been hacked and 3,999,249,352 accounts have been compromised.
Be sure to check out if yours is one of them and take the necessary precautions like changing your password to a more complex one and enabling 2-factor authentication (2-FA).

You can also use services like <a href="https://goo.gl/eeUKnw" target="_blank">Dashlane</a>  or <a href="https://goo.gl/7YPQV7" target="_blank">Roboform</a>to manage your password so that you don't have to remember all your passwords or use same password twice.

You can also check if your password has been pawned from the same website. <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords" target="_blank">https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords</a>. Note: if you enter your password there, make sure you no longer use it anywhere else.

Stay safe online!
