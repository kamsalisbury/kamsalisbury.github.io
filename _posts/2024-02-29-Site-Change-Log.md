After a **totally unnecessary** amount of experimentation, this Portfolio is rebuilt with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Planned improvements:

* Convert to Bulma, responsive first and unincumbered by javascript
* Minimal design with just enough styling to function
* Minimal code

2024-03-02: Abandoned Bulma CSS conversion for now, utilizing Bootstap Pixyll Theme because the code base is more defined for future Bulma conversion.
2024-03-01: Initial attempt at converting GitHub Pages Minima Theme to Bulma CSS.
2024-02-29: Leaping into the initial rebuild.
