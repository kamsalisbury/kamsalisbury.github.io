NLP Research Engineer at [Factmata](http://factmata.com/).

My work comprises of developing and researching NLP/Deep Learning Models to tackle Fake News and Misinformation over the internet.
Previously, I was the CTO at a New Delhi based startup - Neuron, that provided Deep Learning models for NLP through REST APIs.
Having gained a lot from Open Source World, I always try to do my bit by contributing back, mainly on [Github](https://github.com/rishy) and by spreading the word about FOSS. In 2014, I have been a Google Summer Code Intern, with [Mifos]('http://mifos.org/') and developed a [Batch-API](https://github.com/rishy/mifosx/tree/Batch-API) for Mifos Platform.
